        content: `Hey friends, this is Mahender here.
I am going to tell you my experience when I went to Vrindavan. 
Yeah, seven months ago, I went there for worship and 
I was very happy to hear that we were going there.
So my whole family went there with me. 
Let's start from where we got ready.
I am in Rajasthan, Geejgarh.
We packed all the items that we needed, like stove, cylinder, some fruits and gods' photos.
And then we prayed to God for this happy journey. And then we all sat in a jeep and a tempo.
And the happy thing for me was that I sat on the upper side of the tempo and I enjoyed looking at nature's beauty. 
And after some time, the trees hit those who sat on the tempo. We saved ourselves when the trees tried to hit us. 
Now we were getting late and it was 8 pm and we were still in Rajasthan. 
We didn't cross the Rajasthan border yet. And then we got bored, so I started to sing a Radha Rani song and we all sang together.
At 12 am, we reached there, ate food we brought from home, worshipped Govardhan and started the 21 km parikrama.
There were many temples, monkeys and donation boxes. We gave money, fed monkeys and completed the parikrama at Radha Kund.
More story in the next part.`

        content: `Hi everyone, this is Mahender and I'm here to share my story with you. My favourite pastime is visiting rural areas and enjoying the natural beauty. I have been doing this since I was a child and I still love it.

When I was younger, I used to get very excited whenever my father told me that we were going to the village by train. I liked to see the green fields, the mountains, the rivers and the animals from the train window. Sometimes we also travelled by aeroplane and that was even more thrilling. I felt like I was flying in the sky and seeing the world from a different perspective.

But now things have changed. I am in 10th standard and I have many responsibilities. I have to study hard, do my homework, prepare for exams and think about my future. I don't have much time or interest to go to the village anymore. Now my focus is only on becoming a good student and a successful businessman.

I hope you understand my situation and respect my choices. Thank you for reading my blog post and please leave your comments below.`

        excerpt: "A sentimental story about the first bicycle, racing friends, and the feeling of freedom from childhood.",
        content: `Hi, my name is Mahender and I want to share with you a story from my childhood. Do you remember the first time you rode a bicycle? I do. It was 10 years ago, when I was 8 years old. I was so curious and excited to learn how to ride a bike that my parents bought me an old one. It was not the fanciest or the newest bike, but it was mine and I loved it.

I used to race with my friends every day after school. We would go to the park or the street and see who could go faster or farther. I was often the winner, because I practiced a lot and had a lot of fun. Riding a bike made me happy and gave me a sense of freedom and adventure. I felt like I could go anywhere and do anything.

But as time passed, my bike got older and rustier. I started to lose interest in riding it. I wanted to try new things and explore new hobbies. I also had more homework and less time to play. So I left my bike in the garage and forgot about it.

Now, I am older and I have not ridden a bike in years. Sometimes I wonder if I still remember how to do it. Maybe one day I will get a new bike and try again. Maybe I will feel the same joy and thrill that I felt when I was 8 years old. But for now, I will just keep this memory in my heart and share it with you.

Thank you for reading my blog post.`

        content: `Hello, this is the story of my life. This journey started on 2006, the day I was born. As I grew up, problems also increased, like every middle-class child.

One incident I remember clearly is from school. After an exam, the teacher kept us in class because the outside area was crowded. My friends and I started beating the tables loudly. The teacher came, got angry and made us stand like cocks in the gallery. Younger kids saw us and laughed. I felt very ashamed and thought of leaving the school, but it was not possible. After some time, the teacher forgave me, but my friends had to stand longer. Later, we all laughed about it together.

Now, years later, life has become more serious. My parents always solve my problems, but there are some things they cannot do for me. I started preparing for IIT four months ago, but today I feel like I have not studied enough and everything is slipping from my hands.

Still, this is part of my journey. I hope you enjoyed reading it and maybe related to some part of it. This story was written on 14 Feb 2023 at 11 am.`

        content: `Hello, this is Mahender here. I want to share a story with you that I wrote on 6/10/2022.

This is the story of Dausa, a town in Rajasthan. One day, I went to visit my grandmother's home in Dausa. At night, strange things happened. After visiting my uncle, I went to the bus stop to go to my grandmother’s home. It was late, dark and empty. No bus, no rickshaw, no people.

Suddenly, a bike came, its light shining in my eyes. A man stopped and told me no bus or rickshaw would come at that time. He asked me to come to his home until morning. I was scared and refused. He left, then came back and again asked me to come. Finally, I had no choice and went with him.

When we reached his home, he knocked on the door. A lady opened the door with a knife in her hand. I was terrified. They talked, then we all ate food. I thought they would harm me, but instead they gave me a blanket and I slept.

When I woke up, I was back at the bus stop, alone. Then I realised it was all a dream. This is the story of what happened to me at the Dausa bus stop. I hope you liked it.`

        content: `Many people have a competitive mindset and they only want to win. They focus only on beating others and forget to learn something new. Because of this, they miss chances for real growth.

In life, everything is not about winning. We should learn from the situations where we face challenges and problems, not only from the easy moments. A learning mindset means seeing every difficulty as a chance to improve.

One way to build a learning mindset is to start every day with clear intention. Wake up with a plan, a positive attitude and the desire to learn something small every day. Don’t just get up without purpose. When you start your day “in form”, you can focus better on your goals, face obstacles with courage and slowly become a better version of yourself.`

        content: `Hello everyone! Today I visited my village and decided to go to the fort, known as Geejgarh Fort. It has a lot of history and beauty.

I started climbing the fort and enjoyed the amazing view from the top. I could see green fields, blue sky and distant mountains. I felt like I was in a different world, away from stress and noise.

At the top, there was a flat surface where I sat and relaxed. The cool breeze made me feel light and peaceful. I felt like a king on his fort, surrounded by nature. There was a temple of Lord Shiva, many monkeys playing around, and a tap where parrots and other birds came to drink water. It was a beautiful scene.

This small visit helped me forget my worries and remember who I am and where I come from. I hope you enjoyed reading this short story of Geejgarh Fort.`

के भूल जाऊँगा तेरी हर गलती,  
हर पाप, हर अपराध क्षमा है।  
लेकिन दिल को कैसे मैं समझाऊँगा,  
उसी मोड़ से शुरुआत के लिए कैसे मनाऊँगा।

कैसे जोड़ूँगा मैं अपने दिल को,  
दिल तो दिल, मन को कैसे मैं मनाऊँगा।  
कैसे फिर मन को झूठी आशाओं से समझाऊँगा,  
और मन मान भी गया, तो दिमाग पूछ ही लेगा इसका प्रमाण क्या।

कि आशाएँ अब निराशा में नहीं बदलेंगी,  
जैसे ये पहले बदल गईं, अब नहीं बदलेंगी।`

जीवन में इतनी कठिनाई है,  
फिर भी इसी में खुशियाँ पाई हैं।  

बचपन में घुटने-घुटने जाता था,  
और झट से पापा की गोदी में चढ़ जाता था।  

माँ दूध पिलाने आती थी, मैं पापा के पीछे छिप जाता था।  
जब मैं खटिया से गिर जाता था,  
मंद-मंद मुस्कुराता था।  

उसमें भी माँ रो-रोकर अपनी आँख सुजा लिया करती थी।  
दो मिनट न दिखा तो पूरा मोहल्ला जगा दिया करती थी।  

जीवन में इतनी कठिनाई है,  
फिर भी इसी में खुशियाँ पाई हैं।`

मन कहता है तोड़ दे सारी बेड़ियाँ,  
दिमाग कहता है पढ़ ले थोड़ा और ज़रा।  

और फिर आत्मा कहती है, चला जा जी ले ज़िंदगी,  
लेकिन एक बात और सुन ले, चला गया तो आ नहीं पाएगा।  

और मान ले वापस उस स्थिति में आ भी गया,  
तो तू भी फिर खुद को पहचान नहीं पाएगा।`
